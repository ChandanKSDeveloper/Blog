Major problem 1 -> start on :-31 aug 2024 -> solved on -> 1 sep 2024

    main problem is that userData in store / authSlice is not getting updated after adminLogin.
    so , the main problem reside somewhere in adminLogin.jsx
    since, I am not able to see userData in anywhere in other component like home , dashboard etc

    Solution ->  I was using state.userData = action.payload.userData;  -> Just like Github repo of Hitesh sir
                but it should state.userData = action.payload; 
                if i Try to use the first one I will get undefined or null when printing the store userData

    problem occur when I was trying to edit a post. instead of editing , it just create a new post .

    Solution -> I was using -> const post = posts.find((post) => post.slug === slug) -> which will give me undefined
                but it should be -> const post = posts.find((post) => post.$id === slug)
